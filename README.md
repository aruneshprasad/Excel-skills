# Excel-skills
This repository primarily contains different assignments as well as a capstone project I have completed while doing a specialization Excel course on Coursera. 
The uploaded assignments focuses on core excel skills like data validation, working with formulas including criteria, advanced charting techniques, Pivot tables and charts, lookup tools like vlookup, index and match, and finally macro.
The capstone project includes creating a professional interactive dashboard to analyze the performance of a call centre over a period of six months.
